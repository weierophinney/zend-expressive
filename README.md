# zend-expressive

This is an alternate proposal for zend-expressive's Application semantics, and
represents substantial refactoring to the original implementation. The proposal
is use-case driven, and the code was designed using TDD based on the use cases.

Documentation is in [doc/book/](doc/book/).

Architectural notes are in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

Please see the tests for full information on capabilities.
